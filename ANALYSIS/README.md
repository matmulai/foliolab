**Read this if:** You want to understand the problem in 5 minutes

### 2. portfolio_selection_flow_analysis.md
**Comprehensive technical deep dive**

Covers:
- GitHub repository flow (complete implementation)
- Blog/RSS post flow (incomplete - gap analysis)
- Data storage architecture
- Portfolio creation and display

## Quick Understanding

### The Three Layers

```
FETCHING LAYER  ✓✓✓✓✓✓  All sources work
       ↓
SELECTION LAYER ✓------  Only GitHub works
       ↓
DISPLAY LAYER   ✓------  Only GitHub works
```

### What Works

User can:
1. Connect GitHub
2. Go to `/repos`
3. See repositories and select them with checkboxes
4. Get selections saved to localStorage
5. Click "Generate Portfolio"
6. See beautiful portfolio preview

**GitHub flow is complete and working perfectly.**

### What's Broken

User can:
1. Go to `/data-sources`
2. Import blog posts, Medium articles, GitLab projects, etc.
3. Get success message
4. But then... nothing happens for weeks because:
   - No UI to see what was imported
   - No way to select/deselect items
   - Portfolio preview doesn't show them

**5 out of 6 sources lack selection UI and display.**

## Key Files at a Glance

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `repo-select.tsx` | GitHub selection UI | ✓ Works |
| `data-sources.tsx` | Fetch forms for all sources | ✓ Works partially |
| `portfolio-preview.tsx` | Display portfolio | ✓ GitHub only |
| `storage.ts` | localStorage management | ✓ Supports all sources |
| `schema.ts` | Type definitions | ✓ Supports all sources |

---

## The Core Issue

**The infrastructure exists for multi-source portfolio management, but the UI doesn't.**

```javascript
// What's in localStorage after user imports Medium posts:
{
  id: "med-123",
  title: "Great Article",
  selected: false,        // ← Can't be changed by user (no UI)
  source: "medium"
}

// Functions exist to toggle this:
togglePortfolioItemSelection(id)  // ← Ready to use but never called

// But no UI to call it
```

---

## The Fix (High Level)

Three things need to be built:

1. **Portfolio Items Selection Page** (`/portfolio-items`)
   - Show all portfolio items grouped by source
   - Checkboxes to select/deselect
   - Use `togglePortfolioItemSelection()` function
   - Template: Copy pattern from `repo-select.tsx`

2. **Update Data Sources Flow**
   - After fetching, navigate to `/portfolio-items`
   - Show what was imported
   - Guide user to selection page

3. **Update Portfolio Preview**
   - Query all portfolio items (not just GitHub)
   - Render different types (Blog post, Medium post, etc.)
   - Show only selected items
   - Support editing for each type

## How to Use These Docs

### If you have 5 minutes:
Read EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md

### If you have 15 minutes:
Read EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md + flow_diagrams.md

### If you have 30 minutes:
Read all of EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md, then skim portfolio_selection_flow_analysis.md sections 1-4

### If you're about to code:
Read EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md sections "The Fix Strategy", then use code_locations_reference.md to navigate the actual code

## Important Insights

### Selection State Exists for All Sources

Every portfolio item type has a `selected: boolean` field in the schema:
- GitHub Repository: `selected: boolean` (line 24 of schema.ts)
- Blog Post: `selected: boolean` (line 98)
- Medium Post: `selected: boolean` (line 113)
- GitLab Repository: `selected: boolean` (line 49)
- Bitbucket Repository: `selected: boolean` (line 74)
- Freeform Content: `selected: boolean` (line 144)

### Storage is Unified

Both legacy and new storage structures exist:
- Legacy: `foliolab_repositories` (GitHub only)
- New: `foliolab_portfolio_items` (all sources)

The app maintains both for backward compatibility with automatic migration.

### Functions Are Ready to Use

```typescript
// These functions exist and are production-ready:
togglePortfolioItemSelection(id)      // Toggle selected flag
getPortfolioItemsBySource(source)     // Filter by source type
getPortfolioItems()                   // Get all items
addPortfolioItems(items)              // Add multiple items

// They're just never called for non-GitHub items!
```

## Bottom Line

**The application is 70% done with multi-source portfolios:**

✓ 100% done:
- Fetching blog posts, Medium articles, GitLab/Bitbucket repos
- Storing them in localStorage
- Creating appropriate schema for each type

✗ 0% done:
- UI for users to select which items to include
- Displaying selected items in portfolio preview
- Navigation workflow connecting the pieces

**The backend infrastructure is solid. Only frontend UI is missing.**

## Next Steps

1. Read EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md (5 min)
2. Look at flow_diagrams.md to visualize it (5 min)
3. Open repo-select.tsx and portfolio-preview.tsx in your editor (to understand the pattern)
4. Use code_locations_reference.md to find key functions (storage.ts, sources.ts)
5. Plan the new `/portfolio-items` selection page based on repo-select.tsx pattern
6. Create the component and connect it to the flow
