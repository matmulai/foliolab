# Enhanced README Content Extraction

## Overview

This implementation adds intelligent README content extraction to the FolioLab portfolio generation app. The system now cleans and optimizes README content before sending it to the LLM for analysis, removing badges, boilerplate sections, and focusing on the most relevant project information for portfolio generation.

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files

1. **`server/lib/readme-cleaner.ts`** - Enhanced README content extraction utility
   - `removeBadges()` - Removes various types of badges using regex patterns
   - `removeBoilerplateSections()` - Removes common boilerplate sections (License, Code of Conduct, etc.)
   - `extractRelevantSections()` - Prioritizes and extracts project-focused content
   - `cleanReadmeContent()` - Main orchestration function for intelligent content extraction

2. **`server/lib/example-badge-removal.ts`** - Basic badge removal demonstration
   - Shows simple badge removal functionality
   - Can be run with: `npx tsx server/lib/example-badge-removal.ts`

3. **`server/lib/enhanced-readme-example.ts`** - Comprehensive content extraction demonstration
   - Shows full README optimization with section prioritization
   - Demonstrates 70% content reduction while preserving essential information
   - Can be run with: `npx tsx server/lib/enhanced-readme-example.ts`

### Modified Files

1. **`server/lib/openai.ts`**
   - Added import for `cleanReadmeContent`
   - Modified `generateRepoSummary()` to clean README content before processing
   - README is now cleaned before being trimmed to 2000 characters

2. **`server/routes.ts`**
   - Added import for `cleanReadmeContent`
   - Modified repository analysis endpoint to clean README content
   - Added proper error handling for missing OpenAI API key
   - Title extraction still uses original README to preserve formatting

## Content Optimization Features

### Badge Removal
The implementation removes the following types of badges:
- **PyPI badges** - Package version and download information
- **GitHub workflow/action badges** - CI/CD status indicators
- **License badges** - License type indicators
- **Version/Release badges** - Version and changelog information
- **Test/Build/CI badges** - Build and test status
- **Coverage badges** - Code coverage metrics
- **Documentation badges** - Documentation status
- **Download/Install badges** - Installation metrics
- **Generic shield.io badges** - Any img.shields.io or shields.io badges
- **Other badge services** - badge.fury.io, badgen.net, etc.

### Boilerplate Section Removal
The system automatically removes sections that don't contribute to project understanding:
- **License sections** - Legal boilerplate text
- **Code of Conduct** - Community guidelines
- **Security Policy** - Security reporting procedures
- **Changelog/Release Notes** - Version history details
- **Support/Help sections** - Community support information
- **Acknowledgments/Credits** - Attribution sections
- **Contributing Guidelines** - Development process details
- **FAQ sections** - Detailed troubleshooting information
- **Table of Contents** - Navigation elements

### Intelligent Section Prioritization
The system prioritizes sections that provide the most project context:
1. **High Priority**: Description, Features, Quick Start, Installation, Usage
2. **Medium Priority**: API Documentation, Architecture, Configuration
3. **Low Priority**: Other sections (included only if space allows)
4. **Section Length Limiting**: Prevents overly detailed sections from dominating

## Example Results

### Simple Badge Removal Example
**Before cleaning (2003 characters):**
```markdown
# llm-requesty

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/llm-requesty.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/llm-requesty/)
[![Changelog](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/rajashekar/llm-requesty?include_prereleases&label=changelog)](https://github.com/rajashekar/llm-requesty/releases)
[![Tests](https://github.com/rajashekar/llm-requesty/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rajashekar/llm-requesty/actions?query=workflow%3ATest)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/rajashekar/llm-requesty/blob/main/LICENSE)

[LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/) plugin for models hosted by [Requesty](https://requesty.ai/)
```

**After cleaning (1445 characters, 558 characters removed - 28% reduction):**
```markdown
# llm-requesty

[LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/) plugin for models hosted by [Requesty](https://requesty.ai/)
```

### Comprehensive Content Extraction Example
**Before optimization (4516 characters):**
- Full README with badges, table of contents, contributing guidelines, code of conduct, security policy, changelog, FAQ, support sections, etc.

**After optimization (1341 characters, 3175 characters removed - 70% reduction):**
- **Preserved sections**: Project title, description, features, installation, quick start, API documentation, architecture, configuration
- **Removed sections**: Table of contents, contributing guidelines, code of conduct, security policy, license, changelog, acknowledgments, FAQ, support, troubleshooting details
- **Result**: Clean, focused content that captures the project essence for portfolio generation

## Integration Points

### Repository Analysis Flow

1. **README Fetching** (`server/routes.ts:108-116`)
   - Raw README is fetched from GitHub
   - Content is cleaned using `cleanReadmeContent()`
   - Title extraction uses original README to preserve formatting
   - Cleaned content is passed to LLM analysis

2. **LLM Processing** (`server/lib/openai.ts:76-84`)
   - README content is cleaned before being sent to LLM
   - Cleaning happens before the 2000-character limit is applied
   - Results in cleaner, more focused content for analysis

### API Endpoints Affected

- **`POST /api/repositories/:id/analyze`** - Repository analysis with badge removal
- **`POST /api/deploy/github`** - Portfolio generation (uses analyzed repos)
- **`POST /api/deploy/github-pages`** - GitHub Pages deployment (uses analyzed repos)
- **`POST /api/deploy/vercel`** - Vercel deployment (uses analyzed repos)

## Benefits

1. **Dramatically Improved Content Quality** - Focuses on project essence rather than boilerplate
2. **Exceptional Token Efficiency** - Reduces token usage by up to 70% while preserving key information
3. **Enhanced LLM Analysis** - LLM receives clean, structured, project-focused content
4. **Intelligent Section Prioritization** - Automatically identifies and preserves the most relevant sections
5. **Consistent Processing** - All repositories get the same intelligent optimization treatment
6. **Preserved Functionality** - Title extraction and other features remain intact
7. **Better Portfolio Quality** - Generated summaries focus on what matters for showcasing projects

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Real-world README content (llm-requesty and web scraper examples)
- Multiple badge types and formats
- Complex README structures with boilerplate sections
- Edge cases (empty content, no badges, minimal sections)
- Integration with existing codebase

To test the functionality:

**Basic badge removal:**
```bash
# Uncomment the demonstration call in example-badge-removal.ts, then run:
npx tsx server/lib/example-badge-removal.ts
```

**Enhanced content extraction:**
```bash
# Uncomment the demonstration call in enhanced-readme-example.ts, then run:
npx tsx server/lib/enhanced-readme-example.ts
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- **Configurable section priorities** - Allow users to customize which sections are most important
- **Language-specific optimizations** - Different cleaning rules for different programming languages
- **Machine learning-based section classification** - Automatically identify section importance
- **Custom regex patterns** - Allow users to add their own cleaning patterns
- **Analytics dashboard** - Show cleaning effectiveness and token savings
- **A/B testing** - Compare portfolio quality with/without different cleaning strategies
- **Multi-language README support** - Handle READMEs in different languages
- **Semantic content analysis** - Use NLP to identify truly relevant content beyond section headers

## Compatibility

- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Preserves existing API contracts
- ✅ No breaking changes to client code
